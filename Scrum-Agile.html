                <h3>Scrum Methodology Overview</h3>
                <p>Scrum is an agile framework for managing complex product development. It emphasizes iterative progress, team collaboration, and continuous improvement. Scrum provides a structured yet flexible approach to project management that helps teams deliver high-quality products efficiently.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Key Principles of Scrum</h4>
                    <p style="color: white;">Scrum is built on empirical process control, emphasizing transparency, inspection, and adaptation. It promotes self-organizing teams and focuses on delivering working software in short iterations called sprints.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The Scrum framework consists of three roles, five events, and three artifacts that work together to create a comprehensive system for product development. Each component serves a specific purpose in ensuring the team can deliver value consistently and adapt to changing requirements.</p>

                <h3>Scrum Master</h3>
                <p>The Scrum Master is a servant-leader who facilitates the Scrum process and helps the team follow Scrum practices. They act as a coach, facilitator, and impediment remover, ensuring the team can work effectively.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Primary Responsibilities</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Facilitate Scrum events and ensure they serve their purpose</li>
                        <li>Remove impediments that block the team's progress</li>

                </div>

                <p>The Scrum Master doesn't manage the team in a traditional sense but instead focuses on creating an environment where the team can self-organize and perform at their best. They work closely with the Product Owner to ensure the Product Backlog is well-maintained and with the Development Team to eliminate obstacles.</p>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <h4>Daily Activities</h4>
                    <p>Facilitate daily standups, track sprint progress, identify and resolve impediments, and ensure Scrum practices are followed correctly.</p>

            <div class="content-section" id="product-owner">
                <h3>Product Owner</h3>
                <p>The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and managing the Product Backlog. They represent the stakeholders and customers, ensuring the team builds the right product features.</p>

                        <li>Accept or reject work completed by the Development Team</li>
                        <li>Ensure the team understands items in the Product Backlog</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The Product Owner must have a clear vision of the product and be able to communicate this vision effectively to the Development Team. They make decisions about what features to build and in what order, based on business value and customer needs.</p>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <h4>Decision Making Authority</h4>

                <h3>Development Team</h3>
                <p>The Development Team consists of professionals who work together to deliver potentially shippable product increments at the end of each sprint. They are self-organizing and cross-functional, possessing all the skills necessary to create the product.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Team Characteristics</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Self-organizing: No external direction on how to turn work into increments</li>
                        <li>Cross-functional: All skills needed to create product increments</li>

                </div>

                <p>The Development Team typically consists of 3-9 members with diverse skills including development, testing, design, and analysis. They estimate work, plan sprints, and are responsible for delivering high-quality increments.</p>

                <h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
                <p>Sprint Planning is a time-boxed event where the Scrum Team plans the work to be performed during the upcoming sprint. It typically lasts 8 hours for a one-month sprint, with shorter durations for shorter sprints.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Sprint Planning Goals</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint</li>

                    <h4>Part 1: What will be done?</h4>
                    <p>The Product Owner presents the highest priority Product Backlog items. The Development Team forecasts what they can complete during the sprint.</p>

                    <h4>Part 2: How will it be done?</h4>
                    <p>The Development Team breaks down the selected Product Backlog items into tasks and estimates the effort required to complete them.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The outcome of Sprint Planning is a Sprint Goal and a Sprint Backlog containing the Product Backlog items selected for the sprint plus a plan for delivering them.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The Sprint Backlog is owned by the Development Team and is constantly updated throughout the sprint. As work is completed or new work is discovered, the team updates the Sprint Backlog to reflect the current state of the sprint.</p>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <h4>Daily Updates</h4>

                <h3>Product Backlog</h3>
                <p>The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that serves as the single source of requirements for the product. It's owned and maintained by the Product Owner.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Product Backlog Characteristics</h4>

                </div>

                <p>The Product Backlog is never complete and evolves throughout the product's lifecycle. Higher-ordered items are more detailed and ready for development, while lower-ordered items are less detailed and may need further refinement.</p>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <h4>Backlog Refinement</h4>
                    <p>The team regularly reviews and updates the Product Backlog, adding details, estimates, and acceptance criteria to items that will be worked on in upcoming sprints.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event held at the same time and place each day during the sprint. It's designed for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Daily Scrum Format</h4>
                    <p>Each Development Team member answers three questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What did I do yesterday that helped achieve the Sprint Goal?</li>
                        <li>What will I do today to help achieve the Sprint Goal?</li>

                </div>

                <p>The Daily Scrum is not a status meeting but a planning event focused on creating a shared understanding of progress toward the Sprint Goal and identifying any obstacles that need to be addressed.</p>

                <div class="process-step">
                    <h4>Benefits</h4>

                    <h4>Follow-up</h4>

                <h3>Sprint Review</h3>
                <p>The Sprint Review is held at the end of each sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. It's a collaborative working session where the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished during the sprint.</p>
